        <h1>The Lord of The Rings</h1>

        <h3><i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i></h3>
        <p>
            In a fantastic and unique land, a hobbit receives a magical and evil ring as a gift from his uncle that
            needs to be destroyed before it falls into the hands of evil. For this, the hobbit Frodo has an arduous road
            ahead, where he finds danger, fear and bizarre beings. By his side for the fulfillment of this journey, he
            can gradually count on other hobbits, an elf, a dwarf, two humans and a wizard, totaling nine beings that
            form the Fellowship of the Ring.
