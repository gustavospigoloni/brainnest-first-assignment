        <h1>Catan</h1>
        <p>
            The women and men of your expedition build the first two settlements. Fortunately, the yet uninhabited land
            is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you
            succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in
            abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is
            needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right
            places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are
            smart too.
